          <h4><strong>Our mission</strong> is to curate content in an informative and objective way.</h4>
          <h4><strong>We believe</strong> that trying to understand alternative viewpoints is essential to understanding one's own. </h4>
          <h4>We include content from well-respected, balanced sources as well as notoriously disreputable, ideological ones, and everywhere in between. Why? Because they all shape the public discussion. They all influence what people do and how they think. <strong>It's best to have all the pieces of the puzzle.</strong></h4>

           <h4>
             We manually find and label links from an increasingly diverse catalogue of sources. <br><br>

             Each individual piece of content is classified based on our system below. <br><br>

             We don't label all Fox News as right or all Huffington Post as left - we do our best to objectively label each link, so that you have an idea of what you're clicking and can reliably find what you're looking for.<br><br>
