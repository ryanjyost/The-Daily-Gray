             We manually source links from an increasingly diverse catalogue of sources. <br><br>

             Each individual piece of content is classified based on our system below. <br><br>

             We don't label all Fox News as right or all Huffington Post as left - we do our best to objectively label each link, so that you have an idea of what you're clicking and can reliably find what you're looking for.<br><br>
